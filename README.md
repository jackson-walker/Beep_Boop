# Beep_Boop
Quick and Dirty tkinter conversion python project I'm creating as a personal project because why not.

I intend to make this project a personal testing grounds for making a python project look and feel professional. This is one my summer projects for Summer 2016
Intended feature list:

  Text translation from text to robotic beep boops
  
    Ideally this would be both encoding and decoding
    This could be automatic logic (hopefully!) or manual user selection
    This would be based on the binary code of unicode letter representation
  
  A gui with large, resizable text boxes and an action bar for saving and importing items
  
  A lower bar on the gui which gives tooltip information plus processing information ("saving" or "opening file"
  
  
  lezz go
